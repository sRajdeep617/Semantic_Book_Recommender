In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\",\n          \"9780020442608 The \\\"Dawn Treader\\\" is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries.

In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\",\n          \"9780020442608 The \\\"Dawn Treader\\\" is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries.

As the apostle of pragmatism, his influence on American thought is as strong now as it has ever been. James's emphasis on the creative power of faith, will, and action, his opening up of philosophy to the fresh air of ordinary experience, his fascination with alternative forms of belief and states of consciousness, and his impatience with dogmas of any kind--all make him a defender of individual experience, and earn him a place beside Emerson and Whitman as an exponent of American democratic culture. In this volume are the brilliant, engagingly written works of James's early and middle years. The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy advances the liberating argument that each of us has the right to believe in hypotheses that are not susceptible to proof and that such beliefs might actually change the world. The conversational style of these essays reflects their origin in public lectures, as well as James's conviction that truth can be discovered as much in the course of everyday life as in the activities of science or of philosophical speculation. Talks to Teachers and to Students, also drawn from lectures, helped transform the emerging science of education. Here James applies his new psychology to classroom theory and conduct, especially for the primary grades. This immensely influential book has never gone out of print. It emphasizes the role in learning of instinct, play, and habit, along with the importance of engaging the voluntary interests of students. James's warm and sympathetic nature informs his treatment of children, who can best be taught by those who respect the child's autonomy and who avoid what he calls \\\"hammering in.\\\" Psychology: Briefer Course is far more than a shortened version of his monumental Principles of Psychology. It significantly revises parts of the earlier work and adds important new materials. (Students liked to call the longer book \\\"James\\\" and the shorter one \\\"Jimmy\\\".) James's new psychology moved away from discussions of the soul, morality, and logic, and focused instead on instinct, will, and the importance of action and habit. Passages comparing human consciousness to \\\"a wonderful stream\\\" inspired the \\\"stream of consciousness\\\" in the future work of Joyce, Woolf, and Gertrude Stein, a student of James's at Harvard. \\\"Human Immortality,\\\" which defends the possibility of life after death, and eight more of James's most important essays round out this second volume devoted to a writer who was called by John Dewey \\\"almost a Columbus of the inner world.\\\"\",\n          \"9780842356220 When Laura Baxter Jacobs finds out that her husband is involved in an adulterous relationship and wants a divorce, she decides she will love him and remain faithful to her marriage at all costs.

THAT READERS and critics have been eagerly anticipating for over a decade, Gilead is an astonishingly imagined story of remarkable lives. John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.',\n"," 'labels': ['Fiction', 'Non-Fiction'],\n"," 'scores': [0.7766854166984558, 0.2233145833015442]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["max_index = np.argmax(pipe(description, book_categories)[\"scores\"])\n","max_label = pipe(description, book_categories)[\"labels\"][max_index]\n","max_label"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"M8w09rVRe2UN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739009831673,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":334,"user":{"displayName":"Rajdeep Singh","userId":"08632568728721290512"}},"outputId":"3ecb5b1f-a04c-41e1-98f4-655696993345"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Fiction'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[" def predicting_genres(sequence, categories):\n","    predictions = pipe(sequence, categories)\n","    max_index = np.argmax(predictions[\"scores\"])\n","    max_label = predictions[\"labels\"][max_index]\n","    return max_label"],"metadata":{"id":"P9dylmxgfCX9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739009831679,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Rajdeep Singh","userId":"08632568728721290512"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tqdm import tqdm\n","\n","actual_cats = []\n","predicted_cats = []\n","\n","for i in tqdm(range(0, 300)):\n","    sequence = books_df.loc[books_df[\"simple_categories\"] == \"Fiction\", \"description\"].reset_index(drop=True)[i]\n","    predicted_cats += [predicting_genres(sequence, book_categories)]\n","    actual_cats += [\"Fiction\"]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"QwbpmBr8f9rO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739009856706,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":25025,"user":{"displayName":"Rajdeep Singh","userId":"08632568728721290512"}},"outputId":"ec80f934-1361-4d7a-ef96-d1c6ebec44a5"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["  2%|▏         | 6/300 [00:00<00:35,  8.29it/s]You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU.

In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\",\n          \"9780020442608 The \\\"Dawn Treader\\\" is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries.
